Todo:
- Testing Framework: working on a no to low code data/yaml driven testing framework. Instead of writing tests, data to run tests are defined in yaml file (`app_test.yml`). Input data in the yaml are run through functions, apps, integrations, etc and we just need to verify that the outputs match the expected out put in the yaml file. This is mostly done, just need to update the files in the tests directory and finalize the format of the test yaml files.
